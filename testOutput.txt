S - B C D | END
B - VAR B
C - NUM C
C - END
D - REALNUM | END
B - REALNUM
D - INT D

This one is from problem 1 of the exam, with the terminals renamed.
epsilon = END, a = VAR, b = REALNUM, d = INT, and e = NUM
The output I got was 

FIRST(S) = {END, VAR, REALNUM}
FIRST(B) = {VAR, REALNUM}
FIRST(C) = {NUM, END}
FIRST(D) = {REALNUM, END, INT}
FOLLOW(S) = {$}
FOLLOW(B) = {NUM, END}
FOLLOW(C) = {REALNUM, END, INT}
FOLLOW(D) = {$}

This seems to be consistent with the exam answers. 

Here is another one that I adapted from the arithmetic grammar from the textbook:

expression - term {PLUS term}
term - factor {MULT factor}
factor - LPAREN expression RPAREN | NUM

My output was 

FIRST(expression) = {LPAREN, NUM}
FIRST(term) = {LPAREN, NUM}
FIRST(factor) = {LPAREN, NUM}
FOLLOW(expression) = {$, RPAREN}
FOLLOW(term) = {PLUS, $, RPAREN}
FOLLOW(factor) = {MULT, PLUS, $, RPAREN}
